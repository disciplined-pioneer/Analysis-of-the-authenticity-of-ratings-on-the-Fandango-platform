There is a platform called Fandango where you can purchase movie tickets online. Fandango receives a percentage of ticket sales. There is also speculation that Fandango may be inflating movie ratings to attract more viewers and increase profits. Our goal is to test this assumption by analyzing data from film ratings on Fandango and comparing them with ratings on other platforms.
The file "fandango_scrape" contains information about the ratings of each film. The data is presented in the following columns: 'FILM' (film title), 'STARS' (Fandango rating of the film), 'RATING' (viewer rating of the film) and 'VOTES' (number of viewers voting).
The file "all_sites_scores" contains information about the ratings of each movie. It contains the following columns: 'FILM' (the name of the film), 'RottenTomatoes' (the film's rating on RottenTomatoes from critics), 'RottenTomatoes_User' (the film's rating on RottenTomatoes from users), 'Metacritic' (the film's rating on Metacritic from critics), 'Metacritic_User' (the film's Metacritic rating from users), 'IMDB' (the film's IMDB rating from critics), 'Metacritic_user_vote_count' (the number of users who voted on Metacritic) and 'IMDB_user_vote_count' (the number of users who voted on IMDB).
